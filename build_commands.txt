maturin init
 - setup project
maturin build --features pyo3
 - build python package
wasm-pack build --target bundler -- --features wasm-bindgen
 - build node package (with web as target, pass features to cargo)
 - for angular applications bundler seems to be better as it integrates better with webpack (web is thought to be a remote place for your wasm but not be bundled in the end)

wasm-pack pack
 - package node package


custom webpack options https://github.com/just-jeb/angular-builders/blob/master/packages/custom-webpack/README.md
requires custom webpack builder/server, however this enabled the dev server to function \o/ 09d6cc2dc9b223abfdd4dd635681de457c9402f6
additional configs (angular)?  # disclaimer: did not help
 - install custom-webpack as builder
 - add custom webpack conf to augment wasm, add this to builder options:
    "customWebpackConfig": {
      "path": "./extra-webpack.config.js",
      "mergeRules": {
        "module": {
          "rules": "prepend"
        }
      }
    },

Current state:
 - package can be build
 - for angular/bundled apps 'bundler'-target seems to be the correct option
 - I need to find a magic option that just adds the wasm to the final ui-build
